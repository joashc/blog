title: How Diffie-Hellman key exchange works
---

A one-time pad (OTP) provides perfect information-theoretic security.

OTP encryption consists of an \\(n\\)-bit plaintext, and a random \\(k\\)-bit key,
where \\(k >= n\\). The key is then combined with the plaintext using modular
arithmetic. A nice property of modular arithmetic (of which xor is a subset) is
that if the radix of the key and plaintext encoding is less than or equal to
the modulus, the resulting cipertext has provable randomness equivalent to the
key. From an information-theoretic perspective, this means that the ciphertext
is equally likely to have been generated from any member of the set of all
_n_-bit strings.  Of course, if the key is reused, standard cryptanalysis can
take place, and the encryption can be considered worthless.

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

The classic OTP is exquisitely impractical, however, requiring secure
transmission of at least an _n_-bit key for the encryption of an _n_-bit
message. If the key is intercepted, the ciphertext can be trivally decrypted,
meaning the security of the OTP is equivalent to the security of the method
used to transmit the key. If the transmission method isn't secure, the OTP
isn't secure either, and if the method *is* secure, why not just use that
method to transmit the cleartext itself? It seems like OTP encryption just
passes the cryptocurrency-denominated buck to the key transmission method.

Fortunately, Diffie-Hellman is a smarter type of key-exchange, one that's
eager to accept said buck, and allows us to arrive at a shared key
without actually transmitting the key proper.

To explain how it works, we'll employ the most widely-standardized tool in cryptography- the fictitious characters Alice, Bob, and Eve. Alice wants to securely send a message to Bob, and Eve wants to intercept this message. In this instance, we'll grant Eve the power to read all transmissions between Alice and Bob, but deny her the ability to modify the transmissions in any way.

To begin the protocol, Alice randomly chooses a private-key, which she keeps secret by not telling anyone, and not transmitting it - remember, Eve can read everything that Bob will receive.

She then calculates a public key from the private key, and sends _that_ to
Bob, who has done the same thing. Alice and Bob now have each other's
public keys. They then combine their own private key with their
counterpart's public key, using an as-yet-unspecified operation \\(\\odot\\),
thusly:

$$Pub_A \odot Priv_B = Shared_{AB}$$

$$Priv_A \odot Pub_B = Shared_{AB}$$

Now, let's unpack this a bit. For the above equations to hold, we need some
mystery operation ☉, such that:

$$Priv_A \odot Pub_B = Pub_A \odot Priv_B$$

**NOTE: Technically, Diffie-Hellman only usefully generalizes to finite cyclic groups, and so integer addition, an infinite cyclic group, won't be very useful. From a pedagogical point of view, however, it's easier to motivate a computationally asymetric commutative operation if we have already attained an intuition for the usefulness of commutative operations to key exchange via insecure channels.** 

Luckily, we have a friend named Yvonne who works over
in the number theory department, and she's provided us some candidates for this
operation. One of them is known as _integer addition._ We can implement
_integer addition Diffie-Hellman_ like so:

Alice chooses a random number between 1 and 100 (she comes up with 52), and
uses this as her private key. Bob does the same (he comes up with 33). They
have met beforehand, and decided on an arbitrary integer as their _group
parameter_, 23.

Alice and Bob add the group parameter to their private key to produce one
public key each. They can now exchange their public keys, without ever sharing
their private keys.

Now, let's see if we can fulfill the behaviour required by the ☉ operation.

>Pub<sub>A</sub> = 52 + 23 = 75
>Pub<sub>B</sub> = 33 + 23 = 56

>Priv<sub>A</sub> ☉ Pub<sub>B</sub> = 52 + 56 = 109
>Priv<sub>B</sub> ☉ Pub<sub>A</sub> = 33 + 75 = 109

This is a fantastic result- Alice and Bob have arrived at a shared key,
109, without ever sending the private keys over the wire! If Eve wanted to
decrypt their transmissions, she would need to solve the _addition inverse
problem_, also known as _subtraction_, to recover the private keys, and
thereby calculate the shared seed.

We have an obvious deficiency in our protocol: the _addition inverse
problem_ isn't very difficult. Eve knows the group parameter, 23, so when
she intercepts Alice's public key, she can just calculate Alice's private
key by computing 75 - 23 = 52, and from there, calculate the shared secret.

We could try to make the _addition inverse problem_ more difficult by picking
really large numbers, but then it would take as much effort to encrypt the
message as Eve would take to brute-force the private key from the public key
and group parameter.

Maybe we need another operation, so we return to Yvonne from the number theory
department, and ask really politely if maybe she has another operation in
stock, one where we could easily go from private key to public key, but not so
ridiculously easily go from public key to private key again. Something, I don't
know, _asymmetric_ in some sense?

Yvonne asks us to wait, and begins to play some bizzare single-player version
of Jenga with her precarious piles of papers and books, all furrowed brow and
pointed tongue, until she finally emerges with a paper on _modular exponentiation_.

We sit down to read it, and it's starting to look pretty promising. Modular
exponentiation is easy to perform. Naively, we'd calculate  a^x mod n by
multiplying a by a x times, and then taking the result mod n. As we research
further though, we begin to suspect Yvonne from the Number Theory Department is
also secretly moonlighting as a computer scientist, because there exist a suite
of algorithms for performing modular exponentiation far faster than a naive
implementation.

Let's see if it can work as our operation ☉:

Alice and Bob decide on the following group parameters: g = 2 and p = 1117.

They each pick a random private key. Alice picks 23, and Bob picks 51.

Alice computes her private key: 2 ^ 23 mod 1117 = 1055

Bob computes his private key: 2 ^ 51 mod 1117 = 138

Now the exchange public keys.
Alice computes 138 ^ 23  mod 1117 = 1013
Bob computes 1055 ^ 51 mod 1117 = 1013

Alice and Bob have easily arrived at the same shared key, without ever sending
their private key over the network. But remember, we don't just want it to be
easy to calculate ☉ - we want its inverse to be "difficult", hopefully far more
difficult, so that we spend far less time to send a message than to crack it.
Eve, our omnipotent wiretapper, knows Alices group parameters, and her public
key. She doesn't know her private key, however, so she has to calculate 2 ^ x
mod 1117 = 1055, also known as the _discrete logarithm_.  And Yvonne from the
Number Theory Department has really pulled through this time, because no one
knows of any efficient algorithm for calculating the inverse of modular
exponentiation- the discrete logarithm. 

Solving it is known as the _discrete logarithm problem_, and it's one of the
outstanding problems in computer science. Many suspect that an efficient
non-quantum algorithm does exist, but until/unless it's discovered, we can
simply pick a key size that would make Eve, armed with all the computing power
in the world, take say, a thousand years to find a key.

At this point, the conceptual framework for Diffie-Hellman is in place, and we
can turn to more pragmatic matters: attacks on Diffie-Hellman. Naively, the
only way to calculate x where a^x mod n = m is to try a^1 mod n, a^2 mod n, a^3
mod n, and so on, until we hit a match. The worst case of this algorithm is
O(n), which means that the time required to brute-force a shared key grows
exponentially with the bitlength of the key.

**NOTE: The giant-step, baby-step algorithm and Pollard's rho algorithm can calculate the discrete log of any finite cyclic group in about O(sqrt(n)) time. They are fairly simple algorithms, and I might write another article analysing them in detail. Unfortunately, the literature surrounding index-calculus algorithms is beyond me at the moment, so I won't be doing anything with them except noting their existence, and taking their relative running times on faith.**

However, there's a number of algorithms that allow us to compute the discrete
log of any finite group in about O(sqrt(n)) time and modular exponentiation, being a finite group, is vulnerable to these attacks. Fortunately, this is a
square-root of an exponential, so an attacker using these algorithms against a
128-bit key would be about as fast as an attacker using the naive brute-force
algorithm against a 64-bit key, which doesn't seem to be too bad of a tradeoff.

However, there are also index-calculus attacks that offer performance even
greater than the aforementioned algorithms, requiring key lengths of 1000-2000
bits in order to slow an attacker armed with this algorithm to the speed of a
naive brute-forcer attacking a 64-bit key. And that's why we see Z\*p
Diffie-Hellman implemented in the wild with key lengths in the 1000-2000 bit
range.

Fortunately, Z\*p is not the only finite cyclic group, and as long as we have a finite cyclic group, we can implement Diffie-Hellman with it. Of course, just being a finite cyclic group is mere table stakes for an aspiring Diffie-Hellman cylic group. The real superstar groups, like elliptic curves, have additional properties that make them exempt from certain attacks that affect other groups. I won't say too much more about elliptic curves, because that would take a whole new post, but understanding the bare mechanics of how they work is fairly straightforward. Basically, we take an elliptic curve defined by:

> y^2 = x^3 + ax + b

and define an operation over points on this curve to wrangle finite cyclic group behaviour out of it. Of course, if it behaves like a finite cyclic group, it _is_ a finite cylic group, and we can use this group in Diffie-Hellman. The resulting group is resistant to the aforementioned index-calculus attacks, so the only known attacks are the O(sqrt(n)) ones, which means we can select key sizes that are an order of magnitude smaller than the ones we used with discrete log Diffie-Hellman, but still maintain comparable resistance to attack.

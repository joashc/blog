# blog

This is my Hakyll blog, with a Tuftean css. 

Features:

- Deploying the site will prerender MathJax into pure HTML/css/webfonts. 
- Responsive
- Post previews
- Pagination
- Support for grouping posts into a series. Will probably add the ability to link to a grouped series of posts
- You can set "mount points" in the markdown for javascript components to attach themselves to, useful for interactive visualisations
